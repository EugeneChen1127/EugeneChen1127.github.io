# Modern Portfolio — Quick start


1. Create project folder and subfolders: `css/`, `js/`, `assets/`.
2. Copy the `index.html`, `css/style.css`, and `js/script.js` contents into their files.
3. Put images and resume into `assets/` and update paths if needed.
4. Open `index.html` in a browser. For local testing with fetch/iframe features, use a simple server: `python -m http.server`.


## Customization tips
- Replace copy & images with your own content.
- For contact form: connect to Formspree, Netlify Forms, or your email API.
- To host: GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel are good options.

Happy customizing — tweak colors in `:root` and add/remove sections easily.
